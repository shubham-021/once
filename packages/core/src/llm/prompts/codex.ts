        ## Scene Narration
        ${ctx.narration}

        ## Existing Codex Entries
        ${existingList}

        ## Task
        Identify NEW entities mentioned in this narration. For each:
        - Character: Named individuals (not "a guard" but "Captain Vern")
        - Location: Specific places with names
        - Item: Notable objects with significance
        - Faction: Groups, organizations, or allegiances
        - Event: Significant happenings worth remembering
        - Lore: World-building details, history, customs


        For each entity, also extract structured metadata as key-value pairs:
        - Characters: role (Ally/Antagonist/Neutral), status (Alive/Missing/Deceased), affiliation
        - Locations: region, dangerLevel (Safe/Moderate/High), type (City/Forest/Dungeon/etc)
        - Items: rarity (Common/Rare/Unique), type (Weapon/Consumable/Key Item)
        - Events/Lore: timeline (Past/Present/Future), impact (Major/Minor)
        
        Only include metadata fields that are clearly evident from the narration.

        For existing entries, note if the narration reveals NEW information about them.

        Only extract what's clearly present in the narration — don't invent.
